# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project creates the frontend for a very basic todo-list tracking application. I was tired of the ads all over the regular todo-list trackers I tried, so I decided to make this one.

It has numerous vulnerabilities from the different JS libraries I used, thats on the to-fix list. 

##Todo list out the reqs for running it, .env file, amplify url, etc

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
